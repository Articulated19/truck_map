# A Node declaration starts with 'NODE' and ends with 'ENDNODE'
# The body of the declaration consists of:
#     1. The (x, y)-coordinates for this Node
#     2. A list of (x, y)-coordinates for all Nodes, to which there is an out-edge from this Node
#        The list is separated by semicolon ';'

NODE
    5,3
    4,2 ; 3,5 ; 4,3
ENDNODE

NODE
    3,5
    5,3 ; 4,3
ENDNODE
